# Introduction. 
This repository is an attempt to apply the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) methodology 
from programming and software development to Mechanical Engineering Design.

# Scope. 
To provide a library of OpenSCAD modules and functions to accellerate the engineering 
design work for mechancial and structural applications.

# Objective. 
The library should be as intuitive as possible. The primary application is through the use of NeoVim 
as opposed to the standard OpenSCAD editor. The application of the library should utilise, snippets
for auto completion, (ideally an lsp for completion) of a telescope quicksearch for finding items, and 
helper functions to assist in assembly, etc.

# Methodology.
The system will utilise the following approach:
1. Base level entities (i.e. stuctural beams, standard pipe sizes, etc.) applicable to Australian Standards. 
1. Standard level modifications. (i.e. mitre joints, gussets, end plates, etc.).
1. Standard shaft sizes and fitments.
